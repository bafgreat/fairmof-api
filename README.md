# A python API to retrieve MOF information from FAIR-MOFs database
We recently uploaded over 35K curated MOFs into NOMAD in a dataset called FAIR-MOFs (10.17172/NOMAD/2023.11.17-2).
We noticed that most users may face difficulties extracting data from FAIR-MOFs, because we didn't map MOFs with their
CSD refcode consequently searching MOFs using their csd refcodes will not be directly accessible from NOMAD.

This API enables users to access all the data we uploaded into NOMAD,
